Joanna Nasar is a thoughtful storyteller.

She was recently honored to be named a "Top Adventure Creative" by Origin Magazine for her  extensive experience in public relations, communications, marketing, film and digital media, and social media; as well as her ability to use new or emerging technology for good.

Joanna's past projects have taken her to the natural 
gas rigs on the Roan Plateau, to Thailand to trace an endangered cat,  to the peaks of 14,000-foot mountains, and to a remote Island 350 miles off the Pacific Coast of Costa Rica.

Joanna has an M.A. in Journalism and Mass Communications 
from the University of Colorado with a Graduate Certificate in 
Environment, Policy and Society, and a B.A. in English Literature from 
the University of California, Santa Cruz.
